# 🧠 Grokking Algorithms — DSA Practice (Python)

A clean and structured collection of **Data Structures & Algorithms** implementations in **Python**, inspired by the book *Grokking Algorithms*.  
This repository is part of my journey to strengthen core CS fundamentals, improve problem-solving, and prepare for coding interviews.

## 📝 Example Test Case (Binary Search)

```python
# Input
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 7

# Expected Output
3  # (Index of target)
